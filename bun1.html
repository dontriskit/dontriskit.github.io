              <p>
                The performance enhancements in Bun 1.2, particularly in HTTP server scenarios, are substantial. Benchmarks reveal that Bun's HTTP/2 server can achieve speeds up to <strong>2x faster</strong> than Node.js LTS. Even when utilizing frameworks like Express, Bun maintains a significant lead, clocking in at speeds up to <strong>3x faster</strong>. This is a critical factor for applications handling high volumes of web traffic.
              </p>
              <p>
                Performance metrics further illustrate this advantage. In basic scenarios, Bun demonstrates the capacity to handle up to <mark><strong>160,000</strong> requests per second</mark>, whereas Node.js manages approximately <mark><strong>45,000</strong> requests per second</mark>. This translates to a <mark><strong>377% performance increase</strong></mark> when comparing <code><dfn>Bun.serve()</dfn></code> directly against Node.js equivalents.

              <p>
                <small><em>Note:</em></small> <strong>These figures represent a significant leap</strong> in server-side JavaScript performance, potentially reducing infrastructure costs and enhancing application responsiveness.

              As a relatively newer runtime, Bun faces certain deployment challenges compared to the well-established Node.js landscape. Bun may encounter less direct PaaS support on some cloud platforms, potentially necessitating more manual configuration or reliance on containerized deployment strategies.

            <p>
              Furthermore, community support and readily available troubleshooting resources for Bun deployment are less extensive compared to the vast resources available for Node.js.

          <div class="text-modifiers">
            <p>
              Similar to many other transpilers, Bun's TypeScript implementation removes type information at runtime. Type safety is enforced by the TypeScript compiler during the development or build process, but not during runtime execution. This is a common characteristic of TypeScript environments and aligns with typical JavaScript runtime behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
              Developers familiar with TypeScript should be aware that runtime type checks are not inherent to the JavaScript runtime environment itself. Type safety relies on compile-time validation and coding practices.
